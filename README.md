## Introduction
This is the front-end project for DSES, you can find the back-end in https://github.com/GiuseppeLV/dses-backend-hardhat.

**The Decentralized System for Environmental Sustainability (DSES)** was created as a blockchain system to incentivize the population to reduce the amount of CO2, especially in the sectors relating to transport and industry. The incentive is given by the presence of NFTs which are attributed to citizens or industries that consume a quantity of CO2 below a certain threshold. The measurement takes place through tokens defined within a contract that implements the ERC-20 and defines the "Pollution Tokens". These are distributed by States/Nations and Cities to the relevant Citizens or Industries and indicate the maximum CO2 production limit for that specific entity.
Using CO2 sensors, sampling of carbon dioxide is carried out inside public transport exhausts (i.e. cars or buses) or industries. The result is converted into Pollution Tokens which will be deducted from the account of the entity that produced CO2. 
PollutionTokens can be also traded for ETH. In DSES is the State responsible for that action.

## Installation
First of all clone the repository locally: ```bash git clone https://github.com/GiuseppeLV/dses-frontend-nextjs.git``` then install dependencies with by running ```bash npm install``` or ```bash yarn install```.
## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
